## Abstract

This specification defines a cross-chain execution interface for EVM-based blockchains. Developers will be able to have contracts call contracts on other chains. There are two parts to this spec: the "sending" interface and the "executing" interface. The "sending" interface specifies the interface to send a call to another chain; this interface must be implemented by bridges. The "executing" interface must be implemented by the application; it is an interface for executing cross-chain calls. This specification is agnostic of the bridge implementation; it simply standardizes the call interfaces.

## Motivation

Many Ethereum protocols need to coordinate state changes across multiple EVM-based blockchains. These chains often have native or third-party bridges that allow Ethereum contracts to execute code. However, bridges have different APIs so bridge integrations are custom. Each one affords different properties; with varying degrees of security, speed, and control.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

This specification allows contracts on one chain to send messages to contracts on another chain. There are two key interfaces that needs to be implemented:

- `CrossChainRelayer`
- `CrossChainExecutor`

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the origin chain. Users can share a single `CrossChainRelayer` or deploy their own.

The `CrossChainExecutor` lives on the destination chain and executes relayed calls. Users can share a single `CrossChainExecutor` or deploy their own.

### CrossChainRelayer

The `CrossChainRelayer` lives on the chain from which messages are sent. The Relayer's job is to broadcast the messages through a transport layer.

#### Methods

**relayCalls**

`CrossChainRelayer`s MUST emit the `RelayedCalls` event when successfully called.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MUST increment a `nonce` so that each batch of calls can be uniquely identified.

`CrossChainRelayer`s MAY require payment.

```solidity
struct Call {
  address target;
  bytes data;
}

interface CrossChainRelayer {
    function relayCalls(Call[] calldata calls, uint256 gasLimit) external payable;
}
```

```yaml
- name: relayCalls
  type: function
  stateMutability: payable
  inputs:
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gasLimit
      type: uint256
```

#### Events

**RelayedCalls**

The `RelayedCalls` event MUST be emitted by the `CrossChainRelayer` when `relayCalls` is called.

```solidity
interface CrossChainRelayer {
  event RelayedCalls(
      uint256 indexed nonce,
      address indexed sender,
      CrossChainExecutor indexed executor,
      Call[] calls,
      uint256 gasLimit
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: RelayedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: sender
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: executor
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: calls
      type: Call[]
    - name: gasLimit
      type: uint256
```

#### Error handling

**GasLimitTooHigh**

`CrossChainRelayer`s MAY revert with `GasLimitTooHigh` if the `gasLimit` passed to `relayCalls` is higher than the maximum gas limit accepted by the bridge being used.

```solidity
interface CrossChainRelayer {
  error GasLimitTooHigh(
    uint256 gasLimit,
    uint256 maxGasLimit
  );
}
```

### CrossChainExecutor

The `CrossChainExecutor` executes relayed calls. Developers must implement a `CrossChainExecutor` in order to execute messages on the receiving chain.

#### Authentication

`CrossChainRelayer`s SHOULD authenticate that the call has been performed by the bridge transport layer.

`CrossChainRelayer`s SHOULD use [EIP-2771](./eip-2771.md) for authentication and append the address of the Transaction Signer (20 bytes of data) on the origin chain to the end of the call data being executed.

#### Error handling

**CallFailure**

`CrossChainRelayer`s SHOULD revert with `CallFailure` if a call fails.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  error CallFailure(
    Call call,
    bytes errorData
  );
}
```

#### Events

**ExecutedCalls**

`ExecutedCalls` MUST be emitted once calls have been executed.

```solidity
interface CrossChainExecutor {
  event ExecutedCalls(
    CrossChainRelayer indexed relayer,
    uint256 indexed nonce,
    address indexed caller
  );
}
```

```yaml
- name: ExecutedCalls
  type: event
  inputs:
    - name: relayer
      indexed: true
      type: CrossChainRelayer
    - name: nonce
      indexed: true
      type: uint256
    - name: caller
      indexed: true
      type: address
```

### ExecutorAware

The `ExecutorAware` interface follows [EIP-2771](./eip-2771.md) and allows applications to verify where the call originated from.

## Rationale

The Relayer address is passed to the executor so that the execution can easily be traced by a client using the relayer address and nonce. A third party just needs to be aware of a list of Relayers and a list of Executors and can trace execution across all of them.

Calls are relayed in batches because it is such a common action. Rather than have implementors take different approaches to encoding multiple calls into the `data` portion, this spec includes call batching to take away any guess work.

Some bridges may require payment in the native currency, so the `relayCalls` function is payable.

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification is compatible with existing governance systems as it offers simple cross-chain execution.

## Security Considerations

Bridge trust profiles are variable, so users must understand that bridge security depends on the implementation.
